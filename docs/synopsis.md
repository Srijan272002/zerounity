 Project Synopsis: GameForge – LLM-Powered No-Code Game Builder
🔖 Project Title:
GameForge – An AI-Agent-Based Platform for No-Code Game Creation

🎯 Objective:
To design and develop a web-based platform that enables users to build exportable video games by simply describing their ideas in plain English. Using state-of-the-art large language models and autonomous AI agents, GameForge automatically generates game logic, narrative, visual assets, and playable code in Unity or Godot—without requiring the user to write a single line of code.

🔍 Problem Statement:
Game development remains inaccessible to non-technical users due to its steep learning curve, involving complex programming, asset creation, and logic structuring. There is a need for an intuitive platform that democratizes game creation using AI.

💡 Proposed Solution:
GameForge provides a no-code, AI-powered game builder that uses multiple AI agents to handle:

Story and level generation

Game logic and scripting

Asset generation (sprites/backgrounds)

Packaging and exporting playable games

Users describe their idea, and AI handles the rest—creating export-ready code for Unity or Godot engines.

🧠 AI Concepts and Technologies Used:
Large Language Models (Gemini 1.5 Pro) – prompt parsing, story generation, code synthesis

Gemini Vision / Imagen 2 – generate visual assets from descriptions

Autonomous Multi-Agent System – separate agents for story, logic, and asset tasks

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – optional code generation enhancement

Decision Decomposition & Workflow Chaining – agents working in sequence with modular responsibilities

🧩 Tech Stack:
Layer	Tools
Frontend	Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, Framer Motion
Backend	Next.js API Routes, Node.js
Auth & DB	Supabase (Google OAuth, PostgreSQL, Storage)
AI Services	Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini Vision, Google Cloud Functions
Game Engine Export	Unity CLI, Godot CLI, adm-zip (for bundling)

🗂️ Core App Pages:
/ – Landing Page

/login – Google OAuth Login

/dashboard – User Project Dashboard

/create – Game Idea Submission + Generation Flow

/preview/[gameId] – Story, Logic, Asset Viewer

/downloads – Export Game Project (Unity/Godot)

/profile – User Profile and Settings

🔧 Implementation Workflow:
User Login: Authenticated via Google OAuth (Supabase)

Game Idea Submission: User describes a game in natural language

Agent 1 – Narrative Builder: Creates storyline, levels, and quests

Agent 2 – Code Synthesizer: Generates Unity/Godot code for mechanics

Agent 3 – Asset Generator: Creates game sprites/backgrounds with Gemini Vision

Assembly & Packaging: Bundles assets and code into a downloadable project

Preview & Export: User previews the generated game and downloads ZIP file

⚠️ Challenges & Considerations:
Ensuring code correctness and playability (LLM hallucination control)

Asset consistency and art style alignment

Runtime security and API rate limits with AI providers

Game logic complexity for advanced requests

💥 Why It Stands Out in 2025:
🔮 Combines agentic AI, code synthesis, and vision generation

🧠 Real-world implementation of multi-agent LLM workflows

🎮 Focused on Gen Z creativity and gaming culture

🚀 AI-generated games that can be exported and played

💼 Portfolio-worthy project for AI, frontend, and systems engineers
